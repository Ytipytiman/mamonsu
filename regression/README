how to use regression tests:
1. create test files with one command for mamonsu in each one and put them in folder /regression/<test_name>.in
2. make sure you have expected output file in /regression/<test_name>.in.out.exp
NOTE: for template generation tests make sure you have template name and application name EXACTLY as in line of <test_name>.in (or you'll get diff file showing difference only in template name and application name btw two templates)
3. go to /mamonsu and run 
	./test.py ./mamonsu.py regression
4. you will find output files for each test in /regression/<test_name>.out
5. you will find diff (if where is any difference) in /regression/.diff

file list_of_tests contains commands for all tests
